## Summary

CubeFS Release 3.2.0 was released on October 14, 2022. The main focus of this version was the optimization of the BlobStore subsystem for the data layer erasure coding, with the following updates:

- Merged related modules to simplify data flow logic.
- Reduced external dependencies and supported one-click deployment.
- Supported data inspection, QoS configuration hot-loading, and optimized garbage collection.

## Feature Introduction

### Merged related modules to simplify data flow logic.

The new architecture reduced three independent modules and merged them into their associated components, without any changes to their responsibilities.

- The Allocator and MQProxy are merged into Proxy, which provides space allocation for data writing, deletion, and forwarding of repair messages.
- The Worker is merged into Blobnode, which performs tasks such as volume repair, migration, and reclamation.
- The Tinker is merged into Scheduler, which performs tasks such as data repair and deletion.

### Enhanced ClusterManager metadata management capabilities

- ClusterManager added a Key-Value persistent storage interface, providing SET, GET, DELETE, and LIST operations.
- The cluster configuration-related information is stored in this KV storage.
- The background process uses this KV storage for metadata management.

### Reduced external dependencies and strengthened one-click deployment.

- Removed the monogdb dependency: the background task flow uses the ClusterManager's KV storage.
- Optional component Consul: the configuration items that previously depended on Consul in older versions can now be replaced with the actual service address.
- Optimized container deployment, added single-node deployment scripts, and improved CLI command-line tools.

### Supported data inspection, QoS configuration hot-loading, and optimized garbage collection.

- Supported data inspection: timely discovery of bad blocks, repair of bad blocks, and improved data reliability.
- QoS configuration hot-loading: easier modification of rate limiting thresholds to help efficient operations.
- Optimized garbage collection: reduced the number of verification process accesses and lowered the request pressure on ClusterManager.

## Future version plans

Preview of Version 3.2.1 updates:

- Optimized data migration algorithm to improve stability.
Disk repair, offline, and other processes support disk-level concurrency to improve data repair and node offline speed.
Supported garbage data cleaning during specified time periods.
