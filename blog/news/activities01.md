In July 2022, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) officially announced that the distributed storage system CubeFS was promoted from a Sandbox project to an Incubating project.

As the first domestic open source project to enter the CNCF incubation stage, CubeFS has the characteristics of being secure, reliable, high-performance, highly scalable, and easy to operate, truly filling the gap in the open source cloud native storage field.

We deeply understand that the development of CubeFS cannot be separated from the support of every community participant. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all our partners. In order to attract more partners to join and support us, we have officially launched the first developer event of 2023, inviting you to participate in the co-construction of the CubeFS community and build a more secure, reliable, efficient and agile cloud native storage product with us.

We have prepared a gift for every developer partner who is about to join CubeFS and has made a positive contribution. Come and participate in this developer event to become a CubeFS Contributor! Not only can you learn about cloud native storage technology, but you can also meet a group of like-minded peers to explore and grow together~

## Rules

We have carefully selected nearly 30 topics, covering multiple dimensions such as tool construction, module optimization, and deployment optimization, and also marked the difficulty level of each topic. Participants can flexibly choose topics based on their interests.
The following is a detailed introduction to the rules of this event:
