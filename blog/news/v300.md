## Summary

Version 3.0.0 introduces the following key features to adapt to more business scenarios:

- Hybrid cloud acceleration based on multi-level caching, solving the problem of data latency between cloud and on-premises
- Low-cost online erasure coding storage engine
- Support for single-replica storage, adapting to business needs for low data durability
- Client-side hot updates without service interruption during upgrades
- Performance optimizations, including metadata node migration, large directory page retrieval, data node memory pool usage, and metric grading
- Go mod used for project management

## Architecture Adjustments

Version 3.0.0 adds an erasure coding storage engine with the ability to provide multiple copies and erasure coding at the storage layer; it is also compatible with previous versions and can smoothly upgrade to Version 3.0.0.

## Feature Introduction

### Hybrid Cloud Acceleration Based on Multi-Level Caching

The storage system is based on automatic data hot/cold tiering, and users can flexibly configure volume policies to dynamically adapt to business cost and performance requirements, providing more possibilities for storage orchestration.

### Erasure Coding

The erasure coding subsystem has the following advantages:

- Larger cluster capacity
- Higher durability with 12 nines
- Lower TCO, reducing redundancy from 3x to 1.33x or less
- Deployable in multiple availability zones
- Various erasure coding modes can be configured
- Online erasure coding can avoid data migration and save storage space

### Single-replica

Single-replica is suitable for businesses with low reliability requirements, such as Spark remote shuffle.

Users can choose from Single-replica to three-replica storage, and the lower the number of copies, the lower the storage cost and write latency.

## Client-Side Hot Updates

Client-side hot updates can ensure business continuity, especially for long tasks such as AI training or big data analysis, without worrying about service interruption caused by client upgrades.

### Performance Optimizations

- Metadata node migration

By reducing system calls on the critical path of snapshot processing, the migration time for millions of inodes is reduced from hours to minutes.

- Large directory page retrieval

By implementing page retrieval and timeout retry mechanism, it solves the problem of large directory data volume per retrieval, network jitter, and frequent failures.

- DataNode memory pool usage

By improving the utilization of data buffer pools, CPU usage is reduced by nearly 40%.

- Metric grading

By implementing index grading strategy, the index data volume is reduced, and CPU usage is reduced by 30%.

## Future Version Plans

Version roadmap can be found at: https://github.com/CubeFS/CubeFS/blob/master/ROADMAP.md

Preview of Version 3.1.0 updates:

- The erasure coding (blobstore) code repository is merged into CubeFS
- New QOS traffic control system
- Support for two copies
- Optimization of data migration algorithm to improve stability
