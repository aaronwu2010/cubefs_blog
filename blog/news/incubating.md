## Key Milestones

- 2600+ Github stars
- 1400+ Pull requests
- 400+ GitHub issues
- Nearly 100 contributors
- Contributions from over 10 companies
- Released 28 versions in total

After more than two years, CubeFS has successfully graduated from Sandbox to Incubating project, marking a series of progress in product maturity, project adoption, and community sustainability, which can be applied to various industries and production environments of various sizes.

Currently, CubeFS is used for actual business production by more than 10 companies, including large companies such as OPPO, JD.com, NetEase, Ke.com, as well as some start-up technology companies. After being tested with different types of business loads from multiple companies, CubeFS has reached a large-scale production-available level in terms of stability, scalability, easy operation and maintenance, performance, and cost.

"At NetEase, CubeFS solved the problem of ElasticSearch's computation and storage separation and the poor scalability and throughput of local storage used in machine learning business. The project also continues to provide attractive features such as EC and multi-level cache acceleration." - Zcola, Senior Engineer at NetEase.

"At OPPO, CubeFS can build a more secure, reliable, efficient, and agile cloud-native infrastructure, support storage needs for big data and AI platforms, and allow businesses to focus on product development." - He Xiaochun, OPPO Storage Manager.
