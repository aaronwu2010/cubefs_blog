## Summary

CubeFS v3.1.0 introduces the following key features to support more business scenarios:

- Enhanced multi-level read cache for hybrid cloud, improving AI hybrid cloud training acceleration
- Support for volume-level QoS flow control, solving resource allocation issues in multi-tenant scenarios
- Support for dual-replica, meeting the cost reduction demand for businesses with low data durability requirements

Version link: https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/releases/tag/v3.1.0

## Feature Introduction

### Enhanced Multi-Level Read Cache Acceleration for Hybrid Cloud

- Supports directory-level data caching
- Supports metadata caching
- Removed the "enableBcache" configuration item and added the "bcacheDir" configuration item, changing the data caching feature from "on/off" mode to "specified directory" mode
- Added the "maxStreamerLimit" configuration item to specify the number of file metadata cache entries

### Volume-Level QoS Flow Control

- Supports flow control of read/write bandwidth and IOPS at the volume/disk granularity
- Uses high-precision flow control algorithm, which can handle traffic bursts and support smooth flow control

### Dual-Replica Data

- Dual-replica adopts a strong consistency replication protocol that supports modification writing
- Supports updating the existing three-replica volume to a two-replica type (newly written data will be two-replica)

## Future Version Plans

Version roadmap is available at: https://github.com/CubeFS/CubeFS/blob/master/ROADMAP.md

Preview of v3.2.0 update:

Simplify the erasure coding subsystem (blobstore) module and merge the code with the CubeFS repository
Optimize the data migration algorithm of the three-replica subsystem to improve stability
